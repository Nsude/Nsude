# 👋 Hi, I'm Meshach

**`Frontend Product Engineer | Designer `**

I'm an engineer who designs, reads, and writes.

I believe we all owe a debt to humanity to max out our potentials
so we can help those who otherwise would be helpless.

#

### **Things I've built**
- [buymeatoken](https:www.buymeatoken.com): The millions of creators in Asia and Africa can't monetize their communities. Buy Me a Coffee doesn't work there. Neither does Ko-fi. So I built something that does.
- [zag](https://github.com/Nsude/zag): A tool to help me find and send personalised emails to founder who are hiring for roles I'm interested in.
- [Tailwind Class Orgnizer](https://github.com/Nsude/tailwind-class-organizer): A vscode extension that organizes taiwind classes for improved readability of the classes and entire JSX/TSX/HTML code.
- [Thoughts](https://github.com/Nsude/thoughts-app): Think out loud and let AI help develop, and refine your thoughts. Thoughts is equipped with voice-input and multi-user collaboration features.
- [Crumbs](https://github.com/Nsude/crumbs-chrome-extension): A chrome extension that detects the current LinkedIn profile, pulls in the key details, and allows users save them to a list with one click. 

#

### **Fun Facts**
- 💻 I speak fluent **English**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Design**, **React**, **NextJS**, and **Angular**.
- 🎨 I created a design layout every day for a year to learn to design.
- 🌍 Currently open to Frontend Product Engineering opportunities in **Europe** & **US**.
