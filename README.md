# 👋 Hi, I'm Meshach

**`Frontend Product Engineer | Designer `**

I'm an engineer who designs, reads, and writes.

I am passionate about becoming the most I can. 

I believe we all owe a debt to humanity to max out our potentials
so we can help those who otherwise would be helpless.

#

### **About me**
- 💻 I speak fluent **Design**, **English**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **React**, **NextJS**, and **Angular**.
- 🎨 I created a design layout every day for a year to learn to design.
- 🌍 Currently open to Frontend Product Engineering opportunities in **Europe** & **US**.

#

### **Things I've built**
- [Thoughts](https://github.com/Nsude/thoughts-app): Think out loud and let AI help develop, and refine your thoughts. Thoughts is equipped with voice-input and multi-user collaboration features.
- [buymeatoken](https://github.com/Nsude/buymeatoken): The much better web3 version of [buymeacoffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/) (: (WIP)
- [Crumbs](https://github.com/Nsude/crumbs-chrome-extension): A chrome extension that detects the current LinkedIn profile, pulls in the key details, and allows users save them to a list with one click. 

#

###  **Tools I Use**
- **Code Editors**: VS Code
- **Design Tools**: Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator
